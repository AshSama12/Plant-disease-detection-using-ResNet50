# Plant-disease-detection-using-ResNet50
Deep Learning mini project
This project aims to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using ResNet50 architecture to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The dataset consists of RGB photos of healthy and diseased leaves, with the diseased leaves affected by Apple Scab, Black Rot, or Cedar Apple Rust.
